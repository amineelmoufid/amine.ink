  { id: 10, title: "My Personality", content: "<p>   I move quietly at first. I prefer to listen, to observe, to understand the rhythm of a room before I add my own voice. I’m not the loudest in a group, but when I speak, I aim for clarity rather than noise. That is how I build trust,  not by taking space, but by making space feel sharper, calmer, more intentional.</p><p>   I am selective with my energy. Constant new interactions can drain me, but when I find the right team, I give everything. I’ve learned that individual brilliance fades quickly, while collective energy endures. That’s why collaboration is not just something I value,  it’s what I seek most.</p><p>   Perfectionism is in my nature. I’m drawn to craft, to details, to the belief that small things can change how a whole work is received. At times, this makes me slow; I’ve had to learn when “good enough” moves a project forward. But I don’t regret the instinct,  it’s what pushes me to create work that lasts.</p><p>   I carry both discipline and imagination. My training in finance taught me logic, systems, and patience. My work in branding awakened my creative side,  the part of me that thrives on originality, atmosphere, and meaning. Together they shape how I interact with people: structured when needed, inventive when it matters, and always searching for the balance between the two.</p><p>   I value depth over surface. I’d rather work on fewer projects with greater impact than chase endless tasks that disappear by tomorrow. I believe the same in relationships,  quality over quantity, honesty over performance.</p><p>   At my core, I’m someone who builds slowly but deliberately. I listen more than I speak, I choose depth over speed, and I find energy not in the spotlight but in the shared rhythm of a team that creates together.</p>", tabLabel: "3. My Personality" },

I arrived without a certificate in hand, only with curiosity and determination. What I found was a laboratory of discipline: luxury hospitality doesn’t forgive carelessness. Every campaign had to carry elegance, precision, and emotional weight.</p><p>   I learned to think in two dimensions at once:<br>⦁  Conception:  designing campaigns, scripting videos, building editorial lines, and structuring calendars that could guide a team’s work.<br>⦁  Realization:  stepping behind the camera, producing photography and video, editing, grading, and writing until each detail met the standard of a 5★ brand.</p><p>   Those 111 days taught me that marketing is not promotion; it is experience design. A message is only as strong as the atmosphere that carries it.</p><h3>TM – TrainingMorocco Running Camps — Content Creator (March 2025)</h3><p>   I joined this project before its doors even opened, at the moment when a brand has no reputation, no history,  only an idea waiting to take shape. My role was to build that first layer of identity, the foundation on which trust could be earned.</p><p>   I designed the full visual identity, creating the system of recognition that would guide every future impression. I produced content for multiple platforms,  from website to social media,  tailoring the tone and visuals to different audiences.</p><p>   What I learned here was how fragile and powerful beginnings are. With no reputation to lean on, presence must be crafted carefully, every detail a signal of credibility. It was branding in its purest form: not embellishing what already exists, but shaping how something new will be seen for the first time.</p><h3>Marketing Leaders Club (2024–2025)</h3><p>   Here I sharpened the other side of my craft: strategy under pressure. In sprints and peer reviews, ideas had to survive constraints and collaboration. It was less about the beauty of a single thought and more about how that thought could be challenged, defended, and refined in real time.</p><p>   This was where I learned that creativity grows sharper in dialogue, not isolation.</p><h3>Audiovisual Workshop, Université Moulay Ismail (2022–2024)</h3><p>   This was my first playground. Cinema became my training ground for branding: framing, rhythm, tone, and atmosphere are as vital to a campaign as they are to a film. Directing and handling cinematography taught me not only technical craft, but also how visual language carries psychology.</p><p>   It was here that I began to see the parallels: every shot is a message, every brand a narrative.</p><h3>DREEZON (Music Band) — Brand & Content (2023–2024)</h3><p>   This was proof that no project is too small for global standards. With DREEZON, I built an identity from scratch, shaping visuals, music, and storytelling into a single ecosystem.</p><p>   It reminded me that branding is not reserved for corporations. It belongs wherever there is a story waiting to be told.</p><h3>Minhoo — Founder (2024–Present)</h3><p>   Minhoo is my personal lab, a place where I test systems for content creation. It’s still in its early stages, but it embodies a belief I hold strongly: creativity is not luck. It is process,  built, refined, and repeatable.</p><p>   This project is my way of proving to myself that originality can be engineered without losing its soul.</p>", tabLabel: "2. My Experiences" },
